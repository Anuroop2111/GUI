# GUI
#Created a GUI that collects data from the server (here, from log.txt file) and displays the data. The GUI work is still in progress (design and colour are not given; I will add them after checking and testing the app's functionality). Also, the format in which the folder and log.txt should be selected is given inside the help.html page. This is a desktop application, currently creating a webpage using python-flask, where the user can download the exe-file. NOTE: Only the latest version will be updated here.

In order to create exe of the file, type the following in your powershell

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed BFT.py

This will create an exe of the file, and can be used as a desktop application.
